v1.1.6

This release contains a reference implementation of [FIDO Device Onboard (FDO) Specification](https://fidoalliance.org/specs/FDO/FIDO-Device-Onboard-PS-v1.1-20220419/).

It includes the below components:
  * Protocol Reference Implementation (PRI): [pri-fidoiot](https://github.com/fido-device-onboard/pri-fidoiot) is a JAVA based implementation of all the components specified in the FDO Specification. It supports the following cryptographic modes.
    * Signing keys: ECDSA NIST P-256, ECDSA NIST P-384, RSA2048RESTR, and Intel EPID 1.1.
    * Key Exchanges: ECDH256, ECDH384, ASYMKEX2048, ASYMKEX3072, DHKEXid14, and DHKEXid15.
    * Ciphers: AES128/CTR/HMAC-SHA256, AES128/HMAC-SHA256, AES256/CTR/HMAC-SHA384, AES256/HMAC-SHA384, AES-CCM-64-128-128, AES-CCM-64-128-256, AES128GCM, AES256GCM, and RSA/NONE/OAEPWithSHA256AndMGF1Padding.
    * Public Key Encoding: Crypto, X509, COSEKey , X5 Chain.
    * COSE Signature Types: ES256, ES384, RS2048.

  * Client SDK: [client-sdk-fidoiot](https://github.com/fido-device-onboard/client-sdk-fidoiot) is a C based implementation for the device component specified in the FDO Specification. Additionally, it supports an implementation of the device that uses the TPM infrastructure. It supports the following cryptographic modes.
    * Signing keys: ECDSA NIST P-256, and ECDSA NIST P-384
    * Key Exchanges: ECDH256, and ECDH384
    * Ciphers: AES-CCM-64-128-128, AES-CCM-64-128-256, AES128GCM, and AES256GCM.
    * Public Key Encoding:  X509.
    * COSE Signature Types: ES256, and ES384.

  * EPID Verification Service: [epid-verification-service](https://github.com/fido-device-onboard/epid-verification-service) is a wrapper service written on top of the EPID SDK to assist the FDO Rendezvous service and FDO Owner service to perform device signature verification for EPID based devices.
  
### New Features

**client-sdk-fidoiot**, **pri-fidoiot**: Support for http2 has been added. 

**pri-fidoiot**: Support added for Java 17.

### Changes to existing features

**client-sdk-fidoiot**: SNI is now enabled by default and can be disabled based on compile time option.

### Fixed Issues

**epid-verification-service**, **pri-fidoiot**: The version of third-party dependencies have been updated.


### Known Issues

**client-sdk-fidoiot**: Sporadic failure with continuous, repeated usage of CSDK built with Intel® CSE without pause. 
 This is tracked through the GitHub issue [client-sdk-fidoiot#226](https://github.com/fido-device-onboard/client-sdk-fidoiot/issues/226).
